# OBDRetro

Work in progress ... 
The idea is to setup an IO/CAN-BUS board to gather main analog Engine/ECU signals from 80''s and 90's car pre OBD and simulate an OBD interface (with Arduino Uno + CANbus Shield) to be used in software like TunePro RT.
In addition the OBD retro board will also emulate a Mazda MX-5 post 2005 to talk to AIM and Race Logic loggers via OBD/CanBus therefore providing telemetry data for older cars.
